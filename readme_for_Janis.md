Scrapes HD images from google.com
This is a pretty simple scraper, but it demonstrates combined use
of scrapy with selenium.

If you couldn't be bothered running it I have a youtube video which
demonstrates it. Its not that fancy, but it saved me a lot of time.
(I work also doing MLS Listings, they need lots of stock images)

I commented the spider ./image_scraper/spiders/house_scraper.py

To Run:
scrapy crawl my-house-spider
