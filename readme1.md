Some Demo scripts
1_scrapy_selenium_scraper_clean:
___
Scrapes HD images from google.com
This is a pretty simple scraper, but it demonstrates combined use
of scrapy with selenium, that, and I cleaned it up a bit an wrote some comments.

If you couldn't be bothered running it I have a youtube video which
demonstrates it. Its not that fancy, but it saved me a lot of time.
(I work also doing MLS Listings, they need lots of stock images)

To Run:
scrapy crawl my-house-spider
___

2_realtor_ca_script - pure scrapy script that scrapes a real estate site
___
3_selenese_scripts - this is an example of some of the scripts with which I make most of my money. Some javascript is involved, but it is I admit pretty basic
___
4_kijiji - Another scrapy real estate scraper 
___
5_craigs_list_scraper - This script is actually kind of interesting, it uses a proxy. It "flags" craigslist entries (blocks them basically)
___
6_misc_scrapers - google.com scraper - very unorganised
___
7_hh_autoworker - nicely commented script that applies for jobs automatically on hh.ru, it logs in to the site
